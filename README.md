  <h1>Hi 👋, I'm Quan</h1>
</div>

🌱 Leveraging skills from **academic and industry projects**, I aim to build a career as an **AI Engineer**. I’m passionate about developing **intelligent systems** — including **AI assistants**, **RAG pipelines**, and **autonomous agents** — and applying **data-driven techniques** to enhance automation, reasoning, and decision-making in **real-world scenarios**.

⚡ A fun fact about me: Outside of coding, I run a small “underwater AI lab” — my **fish tank**. Each fish has its own personality, and I sometimes joke that I’m fine-tuning them with reinforcement learning 😄. When not observing my aquatic experiments, I enjoy sipping **green tea** ☕🐠.

👨‍💻 All of my personal projects are available [here](https://github.com/ngoquan0904). Please give a star if you like them.
